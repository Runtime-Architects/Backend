Generally speaking, the electricity grid has lower carbon intensity during overnight hours, typically between 1 AM and 6 AM, when industrial demand is reduced and wind generation is often higher. However, solar generation during midday can also create periods of lower emissions, usually around noon to 3 PM depending on weather conditions. You should also consider that weekends tend to have lower overall demand compared to weekdays. For specific activities like EV charging, you might want to use smart charging features that automatically optimize for cleaner energy. The exact timing can vary by season and local grid conditions, so it's best to check real-time data when possible.",
