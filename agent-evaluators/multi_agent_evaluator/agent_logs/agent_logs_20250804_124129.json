Schedule high-energy appliances (washing machine, dishwasher, etc.) for use between 08:00 and 18:00, prioritizing lunchtime and early afternoon.\n2. Avoid using heavy appliances (like dryers or ovens) during early mornings or evenings if possible.\n3.

  "critic": "AGENT PERFORMANCE\n\n- PlannerAgent (Overall summary and correctness)\n  - Correctly categorized the query as \"CARBON EMISSIONS ONLY\" since the user's question was about identifying the best (lowest emission) times to use appliances in Ireland.\n  - Only activated CarbonAgent ‚Üí ReportAgent as appropriate, and issued clear, specific instructions aligned with the system prompt.\n  - No errors in orchestration.\n\n- CarbonAgent (Overall summary and correctness)\n  - Correctly used the emission_tool with the appropriate date range and region.\n  - Properly analyzed the returned CO‚ÇÇ intensity data, clearly identified low, medium, and high emission periods, and formatted its findings as instructed (with analysis header, trends, actionable recommendations, and emoji indicators).\n  - Advice was actionable, summarized trends accurately, and addressed timing recommendations relative to present/future times.\n\n- PolicyAgent (Overall summary and correctness)\n  - Incorrectly responded despite not being activated for this flow. The query (\"best time to use my appliance in Ireland?\") was not related to SEAI grants or policy; per system prompt and PlannerAgent analysis, PolicyAgent should not have participated.\n  - Provided only a placeholder message indicating readiness rather than policy content, which may suggest a workflow misunderstanding.\n\n- DataAnalysisAgent (Overall summary and correctness)\n  - Incorrectly responded. This agent should only be activated when the user supplies consumption data files and is specifically instructed by PlannerAgent. Here, neither condition was met, yet the agent produced an acknowledgment and described awaiting CarbonAgent.\n  - This is a spurious activation, likely due to improper trigger logic.\n\n- ReportAgent (Overall summary and correctness)\n  - Synthesized CarbonAgent's findings into a clear, actionable, and well-structured report (Executive Summary, Detailed Insights, Action Items, Additional Resources).\n  - Avoided agent-by-agent referencing, provided concrete advice, and ended correctly with \"ANALYSIS COMPLETE\" and \"TERMINATE\" as required.\n  - High standard of final user response.\n\nTool Usage\n- emission_tool was used correctly by CarbonAgent with correct parameters (dates, region), and results were accurately analyzed and communicated.\n\nWeakness/Improvements\n\n- PolicyAgent: Should not activate or provide responses unless orchestrated by PlannerAgent for policy/grant-related queries. Needs stricter compliance to the activation condition to avoid confusion and unnecessary workflow steps.\n- DataAnalysisAgent: Should only respond if both a data file is present and explicit PlannerAgent activation occurs. Current behaviour risks workflow pollution and misleads both the user and the report synthesis logic.\n- All other agents (PlannerAgent, CarbonAgent, ReportAgent): Performance was correct and as intended. No improvements needed based on this log.\n\nRecommendations:\n- Enforce stricter activation gating in PolicyAgent and DataAnalysisAgent (possibly via a review of response triggers).\n- Consider workflow logic checks to prevent agents from acknowledging tasks they are not assigned.\n\nSummary:\nPolicyAgent and DataAnalysisAgent both responded inappropriately in this exchange and are the primary performance weaknesses. PlannerAgent, CarbonAgent, and ReportAgent performed correctly and with high quality."
