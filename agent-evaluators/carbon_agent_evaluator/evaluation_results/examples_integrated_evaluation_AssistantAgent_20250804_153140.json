While the values provided are within the valid range (99.0-171.0g CO2/kWh), the agent's use of 'projected' data diminishes accuracy since the reference explicitly uses real EirGrid measurements. Completeness is slightly penalized due to the lack of explicit mention of real data sources and compressed measurements. Clarity is strong, as the agent output is well-structured and easy to follow. Actionability is good, as the recommendations are specific and actionable, but the reliance on projections slightly reduces its utility. Semantic similarity is moderately high, as the core message and recommendations are similar, but the focus on future projections rather than real-time data creates a noticeable divergence.",
